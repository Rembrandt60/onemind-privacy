            This Privacy Policy explains our practices regarding data collection and use.
        </div>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>
            æntenna is designed with privacy in mind. We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal 
            information or user data from the app. The app operates entirely on your device.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Data Storage</h2>
        <p>
            Any preferences, settings, or data generated by the app are stored locally on your device only. 
            This data never leaves your device and is not transmitted to us or any third parties.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>
            æntenna does not integrate with any third-party analytics services, advertising networks, or 
            data collection services.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Notifications</h2>
        <p>
            If you enable push notifications, notification permissions are handled by iOS and are managed 
            through your device settings. We do not collect or store information about your notification preferences.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Haptic Feedback</h2>
        <p>
            The app uses your device's haptic feedback capabilities to provide sensory experiences. This 
            functionality is provided by iOS and does not collect or transmit any data.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>
            We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the 
            "Last Updated" date above. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of 
            the updated policy.
        </p>

        <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>
            æntenna does not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of 13 
            (or applicable age in your jurisdiction). Since we do not collect any personal data, the app 
            is safe for all ages.
        </p>

        <h2>8. Your Rights</h2>
        <p>
            Since we do not collect or store any personal information, there is no data for you to access, 
            modify, or delete on our servers. All app data is stored locally on your device and can be 
            removed by deleting the app.
